Lots of people complain that they want the start menu back, and I won&rsquo;t turn this post into a big debate over the new windows versus old, but I have a tip to make the tranisition from desktop to start screen a little less jarring, here are the steps:</p><ul style='list-style:disc; line-height:28px;'><li>Make your desktop the way you want it to look</li><li>Hit the print screen button on your keyboard</li><li>Open up photoshop or paint or any image editor and save that image</li><li>Download StarDock <a href='http://www.stardock.com/products/decor8/'>Decor8</a></li><li>Use that image as your start screen background</li></ul><p>Once you do those steps, you will have something that looks like this:</p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/OWyBJvRs4ik' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

        "bodycopy": "<p>Hello, my bad for being slow on the posts, reason being I am kind of discouraged to blog because I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting my node server talking to my backbone ui.  Once I get that working I&rsquo;ll be posting a lot more since I&rsquo;ll constantly be updating the ui and testing it by making posts! Anyways, on to the picks of the week.</p><h2>1. Microsoft Surface Pro.</h2><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130528/surface.jpg' alt='Microsoft Surface Pro' /><p>A few weeks ago I traded a Surface RT and iPad Mini to get a Surface Pro, and man am I glad I did. I went from having two devices I used once in a great while, to one device I use constantly.  The battery life sucks, yeah, but for what it does, it&rsquo;s a fine payoff. Since owning the Pro, I&rsquo;ve installed all the games I like to play and able to play them just fine, installed apache and sublime text so I can fully work on it, Visual Studio IDE, Photoshop, and bought a slew of accessories. I haven&rsquo;t had a proper laptop in 5 or 6 years, so I was pretty anxious to get a full PC to carry around with me and the Surface Pro has proved to be the perfect device so far. Also, anyone who likes to draw would love this thing because since the WinTab drivers go released for photoshop, the pen on this thing is like having a mini cintiq with you all the time!</p><h2>2. Xbox One</h2><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130528/xbox.jpg' alt='Microsoft Xbox One' /><p>I&rsquo;d try to justify Xbox One to hardcore gamers but I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m not a hardcore gamer myself, and because it&rsquo;s impossible to justify anything to gamers. Xbox One looks awesome, there&rsquo;s no denying it. More than once this weekend I walked into my living room and said &lsquo;Xbox On&rsquo; and thought how cool it&rsquo;d be if my tv was ready to watch, I&rsquo;m excited for that. I think the majority of complaints about Xbox One so far are premature because we don&rsquo;t really know much about it other than it makes your living room cooler. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you guys to read about it and form your own opinions, my only prayer is that they fix their Xbox store across platforms. I rented a movie on my Surface last night under the Xbox Smartglass section hoping to watch it on the xbox, but since I bought it on the Surface, it didn&rsquo;t allow my to transfer it to my xbox and that is crazy. Don&rsquo;t advertise a feature that is unusable unless you buy it a certain way. </p><h2>3. Identity Thief</h2><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130528/movie.jpg' alt='Identity Thief' /><p>Watched this movie over the weekend, wasn&rsquo;t bad. I&rsquo;ve had my fill of Jason Bateman for the last couple weeks as I watched Arrested Development to prepare for season 4. It&rsquo;s not a genre changing film, but it&rsquo;s fun enough to watch over a weekend without feeling like you&rsquo;ve wasted time.</p><h2>4. Stiegl Pilsner</h2><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130528/beer.jpg' alt='Identity Thief' /><p>I have always been a beer fan and try to get the best craft beer that I can find, but for some reason, I had never tried Stiegl.  I don&rsquo;t know much about it other than I suspect it&rsquo;s like the Miller Lite of Germany, but I like it, haha.  This has replaced Guinness as my new favorite get-one-when-they-dont-have-anything-better type beer. Perhaps I only like it because every time I order one it comes in a giant glass.</p>"

        "bodycopy": "<p>So, lately I&rsquo;ve been used to the gritty every-man-for-himself game Darkfall, and it&rsquo;s great. I enjoy the hard labor it takes to advance in that game, and I enjoy the payoff of every little adventure I go on. Darkfall is an investment, though. Once in a while I wouldn&rsquo;t mind something a little more light-hearted that guides me through a little bit more than just throwing me into the ring like DFUW. I don&rsquo;t play World of Warcraft, and no other MMO out right now really has been able to keep my interest more than a couple of months. I&rsquo;m looking forward to ArcheAge, but that looks like another &ldquo;investment&rdquo; type of game. But one game that is coming out near the end of this year or begining of next has kept my interest level pretty high.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130517/wildstar.jpg' alt='Wildstar' /><p>Wildstar. It looks like a version of WoW if they teamed up with Pixar. I&rsquo;m not sure what it is about it that intrigues me so much, but I just can&rsquo;t stop checking the site and getting excited for the Wildstar Wednesday updates.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t go into a big rant on what the game is because you can watch a nice video that lists all of the main features <a href='http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/what_is_wildstar.php'>Here</a>. I will, though, say why it&rsquo;s been able to keep me interested, and the main reasons are two things: The dev team, and the community.</p><p>Carbine Studios, who is being published with NCSoft, has been the coolest dev team I&rsquo;ve ever seen for an MMO. They are super transparent and converse with the community a ton. They are a bunch of MMO vets, a lot of which worked on the original version of WoW, so they know what they&rsquo;re doing. They know what they like, but they also want to know what we, the players, like. They seem like they are really listening to the players and building a game that THEY want to play, and that&rsquo;s cool.</p><p>Second, the community.  The community for Wildstar is crazy. In a good way. There are tons of podcasts, fansites, and twitter groups. These people are genuinely excited for this game, and I think they all love the fact that they have had a huge impact on the creation of the game. Some of the good fansites are: <a href='http://wildstarradio.com/'>Wildstar Radio</a>, and the biggest one of them all <a href='http://www.wildstar-central.com/'>Wildstar Central</a>.</p><p>Check this game out if you like games, and sign up for the beta which is going on now. That is certainly an email to look forward to!</p>"

        "cta" : "Check em out",
        "bodycopy": "<p>Since starting this blog was mainly a way to keep coding and sharing it with people, I was afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t have enough stuff to write about so I am starting a new weekly article to keep me accountable for making sure content gets added here at least weekly. So this is going to be like a &ldquo;Top 5&rdquo; or &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; of the things that stood out to me the following week. I didn&rsquo;t want to stick to a static number of things, so it&rsquo;ll change each week. This will also not feature the same types of &ldquo;things&rdquo; all the time. It will be from music, to movies, to tech, to comic books.  Anything, really. Let's get started.</p><h2>1. Paula Cole - Raven</h2><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130513/raven.jpg' /></p><p>Paula Cole is awesome. It sounds lame and it sounds kind of silly, but seriously check it out. My dad used to listen to her through his headphones when I was a kid and I&rsquo;d hear her screaming from the other room and always hated it and found it irritating, until I got older and actually listened to the album <a href='http://www.amazon.com/This-Fire-Paula-Cole/dp/B000002NBO/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368450378&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=paula+cole' title='This Fire'>This Fire</a> for myself. Holy crap, it&rsquo;s awesome. It&rsquo;s like heavy metal without distortion. Some stand out tracks for that album are &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo;, &ldquo;Throwing Stones&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mississippi&rdquo;. Her newest album that came out last month is called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Raven-Paula-Cole/dp/B00BJY9HVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368450569&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=paula+cole' title='Raven'>Raven</a> and it&rsquo;s great. It has a lot of throw backs to previous albums. Some of my favorite tracks are Manitoba, Scream and Eloise. </p><h2>2. Jay and Silent Bob Get Old</h2><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130513/jayandbob.jpg' /></p><p>This is a podcast I&rsquo;ve loved for a while. I first started listening to it after reading Kevin Smith&rsquo;s autobiography <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Tough-Sh-Life-Advice-Lazy/dp/1592407447/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368450753&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=tough+shit' title='Tough Sh*t'>Tough Sh*t</a>. I always kind of liked Kevin Smith stuff but I never really considered myself a &ldquo;fan&rdquo; until after reading that book, so check that out, too. <a href='http://smodcast.com/channels/jay-silent-bob-get-old/ ,' title='SmodCast'>Jay and Silent Bob Get Old</a> is a podcast that Smith and Jason Mewes ( Jay ) do together to keep Jason off drugs. It&rsquo;s not a lecture because in every episode Kevin likes to reiterate that he smokes a lot of pot and that you can do what you want if you can &ldquo;Handle your high&rdquo;. I think it&rsquo;s kind of ironic to say that right in front of your best friend who had a terrible problem with heroin, but whatever. The podcast is super funny and Jason always tells a couple sex stories and some drug nightmare stories. It&rsquo;s a mega laugh every episode. I&rsquo;m writing about it today because I&rsquo;m going to see it next weekend at the Vic! Snoochie Boochies.</p><h2>3. Arrested Development</h2><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130513/arrested-development.jpg' /></p><p>Not much to say here. I started rewatching it this weekend in preparation for the NEW SEASON. Yes, NEW SEASON of Arrested Development on Netflix. I imagine anyone who likes this show is as pumped as I am. Hoping to be through all three seasons before the 26th, so far I am on target.</p><p>Have a good week everybody.</p>"

        "bodycopy": "<p>You know that feeling you get when you just received a big lump some of cash from the bank and you go out on the town with it all stuffed in your wallet? The feeling where you're constantly checking your back pocket to make sure it&rsquo;s still there? Well that's exactly how I feel when I play what I&rsquo;m playing this month.</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WW_TnIRgVEc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>That&rsquo;s right, Darkfall Unholy Wars is what I&rsquo;m playing. This ain&rsquo;t your grandma&rsquo;s MMO. It&rsquo;s an action packed survival of the fittest, and only the fittest. If you ain&rsquo;t fit, you&rsquo;re dead. And ALL of your stuff is gone.</p><p>DFUW doesn&rsquo;t have quests. It doesn&rsquo;t have levels. It doesn&rsquo;t even have a story. What it does have is the best possible open world pvp experience you&rsquo;re going to find anywhere for a long time. What makes it so good? Well, for starters, the combat is completely twitch/skill based. It&rsquo;s like a fantasy FPS game that you shoot arrows and whirl spells at people in real time with real aim. You have to account for the arc, speed and trajectory of each blast.</p><p>Another key feature is territory ownership. Large guilds and organized players can claim areas of the world and literally own it. You can live in your own guild keep and kill any wanderers if they get too close. You can seige an enemies keep and take it for yourself on your quest for world domination.</p><p>The biggest downfall of Darkfall is the grind it takes to get to a competing level. It certainly rewards hardcore players, which is something I don't really disagree with. Modern MMO&rsquo;s are starting to cater too much to the casual WoW crowd. My issue is how tedious and boring the grind can be. One thing you need to do to survive is gather a ton of resources and craft your armor and weapons because just about every time you die, you can bet you&rsquo;ll have to replace your gear. Luckily gear is pretty easy to come by in Darkfall, but I think they could have made the harvesting a little less mind numbing.  All you do is stand in front of a node and hit it over and over and over until it&rsquo;s empty, then move on to the next one. I'm not sure what they could have done to combat this, but some sort of mini game or SWG-style offline harvesting are a couple ideas.</p><p>The best part of Darkfall is just how epic it truly feels. Every time you venture away from the limited safe zones it&rsquo;s like an adventure in itself. Traveling from one city to another really feels like a journey. To me, that is Darkfalls form of &ldquo;questing&rdquo;, and man, does it feel a lot cooler than the average &ldquo;go kill 10 rats&rdquo; quest. I mean, how can a game where you and 6 or 7 other dudes get on a boat to stand on it for hours and go fishing be so damn fun?! Just watch this video of us being idiots. We were sailing on the ocean and saw a dragon flying in the air and one of us decided to shoot at it resulting in the video below (no, I'm not the one screaming like a girl).</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/q7CL4uhj8Ao' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in world pvp, crafting your own gear, and hunting mobs in the style of pre-cu SWG, do yourself a favor and check out <a href='http://www.darkfallonline.com/' target='_blank'>Darkfall Unholy Wars</a>.

        "cta" : "Check it",
        "bodycopy": "<p>When I was a kid, I was led to believe that Subaru was an Australian car company, and for some reason that fascinated me. I don't really know why. It wasn't American, and it &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; Japanese. It was used to drive off-road and looked a level of badassness I've never seen before. I'm talking about the WRC Colin McRae Subaru Impreza 22b.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/22b.jpg' alt='Colin McRae 22b' /></p><p>I was hooked on Subaru ever since. The blue and gold of the 2.5rs&rsquo;s and WRX's coming out over the years got cooler and cooler. As I got older, toward driving age, I started researching Subaru more. In the process I found that they weren&rsquo;t actually Australian cars, but by that time I didn&rsquo;t care, I already knew it was the car for me.  I drove to Wisconsin to look at a 1999 Impreza 2.5rs coupe. I was a bigger fan of the sedans but the coupe would have sufficed. When I got there, the car had a lot of problems and the paint job was really bad, I was pretty bummed. On the way home from Madison, out of the corner of my eye, I saw what had to be a sign from the heavens. It was a 2000 Impreza 2.5rs sedan in Blue Ridge Pearl with gold wheels. I took it home the next day.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/25rs.jpg' alt='My 2000 2.5rs' /></p><p>Here&rsquo;s a tip: There is a big difference between wanting a car and actually owning that car. Before I got it, I had all these plans to make it cool and &ldquo;soup it up&rdquo; or whatever. Once the car is in your posession you now have to not only worry about paying for the car, but paying for every time the car needs to be maintained. Eventually, if you're broke enough, you just start spending money to keep the car on the road, let alone add any upgrades.</p><p>After owning the 2.5rs for 4 or 5 years, I was ultra broke. I was in college and didn&rsquo;t have a job. So the car sadly became a point-A to point-B vehicle, and by the time I sold it, it was in a shameful form of terrible shape. Multiple accidents, neglect and pure brokeness killed that car and I'm the only one to blame for it.</p><p>Fast-forward to now. I&rsquo;m older, employed, and still crazy about Subaru. I decided to seek redemption for murdering my first Subaru and ask the car gods to forgive me by leading me to a new car to call my own. Last summer I did just that, I bought a 2004 WRX. It has low miles and was lightly modified by the previous owner. Oh, and it&rsquo;s blue and gold, just like I like em.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/wrx.jpg' alt='My new WRX'/></p><p>Even though I have now aquired much more time and money over the years, it doesn't change the fact that I am a complete noob when it comes to cars, but I am determained to learn as much as I can and treat this car as good as possible, no matter how silly I look in the process. I have already learned a ton on the Subaru forums at <a href='http://www.nasioc.com' target='_blank'>NASIOC</a> and joined a pretty kick-A group on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/442932152412358/?fref=ts' target='_blank'>Facebook</a>. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people and started going to meet-ups. Last weekend I graduated from ultra-noob to noob after going to my first Dyno tune. So, I&rsquo;m getting better and learning a lot, even though I still managed to kill the car (first time in years) driving on to the dyno. The car did ok at 235hp/233 torque. I&rsquo;m now on a quest for 300hp and a ton of knowledge, friends, and fun experiences with my Subaru.</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/TuayYDHIp_0?list=UUVlCp6DjDA7H0y0AIeDQFXg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"
