The feeling where you're constantly checking your back pocket to make sure it&rsquo;s still there? Well that's exactly how I feel when I play what I&rsquo;m playing this month.</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WW_TnIRgVEc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>That&rsquo;s right, Darkfall Unholy Wars is what I&rsquo;m playing. This ain&rsquo;t your grandma&rsquo;s MMO. It&rsquo;s an action packed survival of the fittest, and only the fittest. If you ain&rsquo;t fit, you&rsquo;re dead. And ALL of your stuff is gone.</p><p>DFUW doesn&rsquo;t have quests. It doesn&rsquo;t have levels. It doesn&rsquo;t even have a story. What it does have is the best possible open world pvp experience you&rsquo;re going to find anywhere for a long time. What makes it so good? Well, for starters, the combat is completely twitch/skill based. It&rsquo;s like a fantasy FPS game that you shoot arrows and whirl spells at people in real time with real aim. You have to account for the arc, speed and trajectory of each blast.</p><p>Another key feature is territory ownership. Large guilds and organized players can claim areas of the world and literally own it. You can live in your own guild keep and kill any wanderers if they get too close. You can seige an enemies keep and take it for yourself on your quest for world domination.</p><p>The biggest downfall of Darkfall is the grind it takes to get to a competing level. It certainly rewards hardcore players, which is something I don't really disagree with. Modern MMO&rsquo;s are starting to cater too much to the casual WoW crowd. My issue is how tedious and boring the grind can be. One thing you need to do to survive is gather a ton of resources and craft your armor and weapons because just about every time you die, you can bet you&rsquo;ll have to replace your gear. Luckily gear is pretty easy to come by in Darkfall, but I think they could have made the harvesting a little less mind numbing.  All you do is stand in front of a node and hit it over and over and over until it&rsquo;s empty, then move on to the next one. I'm not sure what they could have done to combat this, but some sort of mini game or SWG-style offline harvesting are a couple ideas.</p><p>The best part of Darkfall is just how epic it truly feels. Every time you venture away from the limited safe zones it&rsquo;s like an adventure in itself. Traveling from one city to another really feels like a journey. To me, that is Darkfalls form of &ldquo;questing&rdquo;, and man, does it feel a lot cooler than the average &ldquo;go kill 10 rats&rdquo; quest. I mean, how can a game where you and 6 or 7 other dudes get on a boat to stand on it for hours and go fishing be so damn fun?! Just watch this video of us being idiots. We were sailing on the ocean and saw a dragon flying in the air and one of us decided to shoot at it resulting in the video below (no, I'm not the one screaming like a girl).</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/q7CL4uhj8Ao' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in world pvp, crafting your own gear, and hunting mobs in the style of pre-cu SWG, do yourself a favor and check out <a href='http://www.darkfallonline.com/' target='_blank'>Darkfall Unholy Wars</a>.

        "bodycopy": "<p>When I was a kid, I was led to believe that Subaru was an Australian car company, and for some reason that fascinated me. I don't really know why. It wasn't American, and it &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; Japanese. It was used to drive off-road and looked a level of badassness I've never seen before. I'm talking about the WRC Colin McRae Subaru Impreza 22b.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/22b.jpg' alt='Colin McRae 22b' /></p><p>I was hooked on Subaru ever since. The blue and gold of the 2.5rs&rsquo;s and WRX's coming out over the years got cooler and cooler. As I got older, toward driving age, I started researching Subaru more. In the process I found that they weren&rsquo;t actually Australian cars, but by that time I didn&rsquo;t care, I already knew it was the car for me.  I drove to Wisconsin to look at a 1999 Impreza 2.5rs coupe. I was a bigger fan of the sedans but the coupe would have sufficed. When I got there, the car had a lot of problems and the paint job was really bad, I was pretty bummed. On the way home from Madison, out of the corner of my eye, I saw what had to be a sign from the heavens. It was a 2000 Impreza 2.5rs sedan in Blue Ridge Pearl with gold wheels. I took it home the next day.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/25rs.jpg' alt='My 2000 2.5rs' /></p><p>Here&rsquo;s a tip: There is a big difference between wanting a car and actually owning that car. Before I got it, I had all these plans to make it cool and &ldquo;soup it up&rdquo; or whatever. Once the car is in your posession you now have to not only worry about paying for the car, but paying for every time the car needs to be maintained. Eventually, if you're broke enough, you just start spending money to keep the car on the road, let alone add any upgrades.</p><p>After owning the 2.5rs for 4 or 5 years, I was ultra broke. I was in college and didn&rsquo;t have a job. So the car sadly became a point-A to point-B vehicle, and by the time I sold it, it was in a shameful form of terrible shape. Multiple accidents, neglect and pure brokeness killed that car and I'm the only one to blame for it.</p><p>Fast-forward to now. I&rsquo;m older, employed, and still crazy about Subaru. I decided to seek redemption for murdering my first Subaru and ask the car gods to forgive me by leading me to a new car to call my own. Last summer I did just that, I bought a 2004 WRX. It has low miles and was lightly modified by the previous owner. Oh, and it&rsquo;s blue and gold, just like I like em.</p><p><img src='http://www.babbitt.is/images/blog/20130507/wrx.jpg' alt='My new WRX'/></p><p>Even though I have now aquired much more time and money over the years, it doesn't change the fact that I am a complete noob when it comes to cars, but I am determained to learn as much as I can and treat this car as good as possible, no matter how silly I look in the process. I have already learned a ton on the Subaru forums at <a href='http://www.nasioc.com' target='_blank'>NASIOC</a> and joined a pretty kick-A group on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/442932152412358/?fref=ts' target='_blank'>Facebook</a>. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people and started going to meet-ups. Last weekend I graduated from ultra-noob to noob after going to my first Dyno tune. So, I&rsquo;m getting better and learning a lot, even though I still managed to kill the car (first time in years) driving on to the dyno. The car did ok at 235hp/233 torque. I&rsquo;m now on a quest for 300hp and a ton of knowledge, friends, and fun experiences with my Subaru.</p><p><iframe style='width:100%; height:360px;' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/TuayYDHIp_0?list=UUVlCp6DjDA7H0y0AIeDQFXg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>"
